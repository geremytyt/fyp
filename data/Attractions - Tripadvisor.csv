In the 1830s Sarawak, a province of the once-mighty Sultanate of Brunei in north-west Borneo, was ravaged by piratical raiding and rebellion against Brunei rule. Inspired by stories of its natural wonders and diverse indigenous cultures, a bold English adventurer, James Brooke, arrived on its shores in his yacht, Royalist, in August 1839. He was to forge a unique bond with its peoples and together they built the foundations of today's Sarawak. The displays focus on the people, places and events that have shaped the state. They take us on a journey through a century of 'White Rajah' rule that began in September 1841, was shattered by the Japanese invasion of December 1941 and ended in July 1946 with Sarawak's annexation as a British Crown Colony. The subsequent move towards political independence culminated in Sarawak's part in forming the Federation of Malaysia in September 1963.",,"Fort Margherita Brooke Museum, Kuching 93050 Malaysia",4.5

Years later in 1924, the ferry service was acquired by the Penang Port Commission (formerly Penang Harbour Board) through its subsidiary, Penang Port Sdn Bhd.
